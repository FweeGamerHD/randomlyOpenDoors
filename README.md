# randomlyOpenDoors
A simple plugin for SCP:SL that gives every special door to be open with a configurable chance.

I am tinybrain so I only got the special doors to work (eg. Gates, Checkpoints, ArmoryDoors etc.)

In the Config you can set the chance at which said doors can be open at the start of a round.
